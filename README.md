# minions

Minions is a simple tool for managing processes that can be spawned from nix flakes. I'm using it primarily to manage long running tools or services on a raspi, but anything you can spawn with `nix run {flake_url}` should work.

Check out the [initial version](https://github.com/fordtom/minions-zig) (serving static HTML using Zig).
